A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started - STAR NEWS APP

This application provides latest news from different news broadcasting channels like BBC, Aljazeera etc.  The application automatically detects your Location and fetch latest news base on the location, though you can still change the location in the settings to wherever you want. There is a Country built, it contains the list off all countries, user can choose any country form the list. And the app will find news base on that Country.

The application is intelligent enough to read each news for user to listen instead of user to read. User can be able to change the entire theme of the application, its fully customizable.
