## Getting Started - SN MOBILE APP

It's a news application that provides latest news from different news broadcasting channels like BBC, Aljazeera etc.  The application automatically detects users' location and fetch latest news base on the device location, though you can still change the location in the settings screen to a diffferent one. User's have the choice of choosing any country from a list. And the app will find news base on the country selected.

The application is intelligent enough to read each news for user to listen instead of user to read. User can be able to change the entire theme of the application, its fully customizable.
